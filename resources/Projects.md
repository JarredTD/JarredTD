# Project Ideas
## Chord Quiz
Simple program which displays chord names in a random fashion. 
- Would read some human readable configurable file format to know which chords to use. 
- Could have a menu which allows you to select or create your own grouping of chords.
- Could show the chart for how to play the chord, or at least the notes. 

## Trading Bot
- Web server which manages refresh token weekly through a callback url. 
- Some system for applying an options trading strategy.
- Scalable to multiple accounts?

## Algorithm Visualizer
- Python library to be used within an algorithm, which would allow easy visualization.
- Library could potentionally create some output that another program would use to do the visualizations instead.
